** Camera problem **
The UP vector (or something else) is broken, from time to time the camera movement
became very sluggish. This seems to be more evident when the rotation mechanism is used..

** Models **
The models are way too comples.. and ugly.. fix them..

** Shaders **
Need to use just one shader for all, this continuous switch of shaders
if a pain for the performance
